## Installing LuaBlam

You can install LuaBlam into Halo Custom Edition using [Mercury - Package Manager](https://github.com/Sledmine/Mercury).<br>
```
mercury install luablam
```
**WARNING!!!**: LuaBlam package from **Mercury** repository is minified, if you want to look at source code comments and readable sentences you need to use the files from this branch.

Use the line above to download and install it from the **Mercury** repository.

We really recommend you to use **Mercury** to install it, otherwise you can download the "luablam.lua" library from this repository and move it in to "Halo Custom Edition\lua".
